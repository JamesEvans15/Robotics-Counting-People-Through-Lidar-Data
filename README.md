# Robotics-Counting-People-Through-Lidar-Data
This project was completed in my CSCE-452 course, Robotics and Spatial Intelligence, in collaboration with Aidan Heffron and Rohit Shankar.

In this project we were given a collection bag files recorded by a robot equipped with a laser range finder (LIDAR). When each of these bags was recorded, the robot and the nearby obstacles remained motionless. However, in each case, one or more people walked past the robot. We were tasked to create a system to identify and track the people that the robot sees, and to count the number of unique people that appear.

For further specification and a more detailed overview on the code itself, there is a report titled Project3-Robotics within the repository.
